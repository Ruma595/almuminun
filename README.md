# Al Mu'minun
Al mu'uminun was a project I made (1 year ago)
I can't continue this project and I want to share it with you!

# How it works
I used Python Flask for the backend and a database with sqlite3 to store quran surah
Finally, it's in French

# Extra
If you want to see different version of the mock-up go to: https://www.figma.com/community/file/1304495448886673767/al-muminun

My favorite is the third version but I don't have the time to code this :(
